# Intro to Data Analysis for Neuroscientists with Python and Pandas

This is a highly-intensive, hands-on workshop, where participants take the time to learn Python through practice in small groups.  Each session is organized around a theme, with three exercises done in-class and one homework exercises done in-between sessions to practice and prepare for the next session.
